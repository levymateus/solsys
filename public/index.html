                </div>
                <p>The Solar System[b] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and
                    the
                    objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[c] Of the objects
                    that
                    orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets,[d] with the
                    remainder
                    being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
                    Of the
                    objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are
                    larger than
                    the smallest planet, Mercury.</p>

                <p>
                    The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational
                    collapse of
                    a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's
                    mass is
                    in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in
                    Jupiter. The
                    four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are
                    terrestrial
                    planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer
                    planets are
                    giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials.
                    The two
                    largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed
                    mainly of
                    hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are
                    ice
                    giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting
                    points
                    compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water,
                    ammonia and
                    methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a
                    nearly
                    flat disc called the ecliptic.

                    The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[f] The asteroid belt,
                    which lies
                    between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects
                    composed, like
                    the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie
                    the
                    Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian
                    objects
                    composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population
                    of
                    sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to
                    have
                    rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as
                    to how
                    many there will prove to be.[9][10] Such objects are categorized as
                    dwarf
                    planets. The only certain dwarf planet is Pluto, with another
                    trans-Neptunian
                    object, Eris, expected to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to
                    being a
                    dwarf planet.[f] In addition to these two regions, various other
                    small-body
                    populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds,
                    freely
                    travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible
                    dwarf
                    planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural
                    satellites,
                    usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is
                    encircled by
                    planetary rings of dust and other small objects.

                    The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun,
                    creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the
                    heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind
                    is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to
                    the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the
                    source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand
                    times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion
                    Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
